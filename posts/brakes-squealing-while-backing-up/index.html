Don’t worry, we have the solution for you! In this article, we will guide you through simple steps to identify and fix the source of the noise in your car or truck. Whether you have recently had a brake job done or you are concerned about potential issues in the future, this article will help you understand what to look for and how to resolve the problem effectively.\nBefore we dive into the detailed steps, let’s first take a moment to understand the screeching sound that we are addressing. This noise can occur not only when braking in reverse, but also when moving forward. It is important to pay attention to this symptom as it can indicate an underlying issue with your braking system.\nNow, let’s get started with the step-by-step process to identify and eliminate the screeching noise in your vehicle:\nStep 1: Visual Inspection Even before removing the tire, you may notice something through the rim hole that could be causing the noise. Look for any backing sheathing or hardware plates that have fallen down and are riding against each other. This metal-on-metal contact can cause a squeaking noise and potential damage. Additionally, check if there is caliper grease on the outside of the tins where the brake pads ride. This can also contribute to the noise, as it is not recommended to have grease in this location.\nStep 2: Removing the Caliper To further investigate, you will need to remove the caliper. Use a 14mm wrench to loosen the slider bolt and remove it. This will allow you to access the shims and hardware that may be causing the noise. Take note of any bending or damage to the tins and thoroughly clean the area from dirt and debris.\nStep 3: Examining the Rotor Next, focus on the rotor to determine if there are any issues causing the noise. Look for signs of dirt, sand, or brake dust buildup that may compromise the performance of the brake pads. Clean the rotor and carefully inspect it for any damage or warping.\nStep 4: Checking the Backing Plate Pay close attention to the backing plate, which should not have any coating on the top. Sand and brake dust can accumulate on the coated surface, preventing the brake pad from moving freely. Additionally, ensure that the stainless steel tin on the brake pad is not rusted, as it should remain unaffected by rust. The brake pad itself should be coated and able to glide smoothly on the stainless steel.\nStep 5: Assessing the Hub Examine the hub, where the parking brake shoes ride. Look for any marks or signs of rubbing that may indicate contact with the backing plate. This can help determine if the backing plate is causing the noise. Clean the hub thoroughly and manipulate the plate as needed to minimize any contact.\nStep 6: Adjusting the Parking Brake Shoes If the screeching noise persists, it may be necessary to adjust the parking brake shoes. They should be cleaned, and a thick dielectric grease or caliper grease should be applied to ensure smooth movement. Adjust the shoes properly to ensure they are parallel to avoid any misalignment or contact with other surfaces.\nStep 7: Test and Fine-Tuning After making any necessary adjustments, reassemble the brake components and put the rotor back on. Before tightening the lug nuts, take a moment to spin the rotor and listen for any remaining noise. If you still hear the screeching sound, repeat the process of manipulating the backing plate until the noise disappears.\nBy following these simple steps, you can effectively identify and eliminate the screeching noise that occurs when braking in reverse. Remember to conduct a thorough visual inspection, clean the necessary components, and adjust the parking brake shoes if needed. Taking the time to address this issue will not only provide a quieter and smoother ride, but it will also contribute to the overall performance and safety of your vehicle.\n","wordCount":"671","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sonia Holmes"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://thecarcolony.github.io/posts/brakes-squealing-while-backing-up/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Car Colony","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://thecarcolony.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/ accesskey=h title="The Car Colony (Alt + H)"><img src=https://thecarcolony.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Car Colony</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Screeching Sound When Braking in Reverse?
