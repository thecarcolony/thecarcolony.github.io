We will analyze their inventory levels, sales figures, and model offerings to understand why Jeep vehicles are not selling as well as they used to. Additionally, we will touch upon the issue of perceived reliability and how it affects consumers’ purchasing decisions. So, let’s get started!\nThe Facts and Figures Jeep currently holds the second-largest day supply of car inventory in the United States, right after Buick. This means that Jeep dealerships have more inventory than their competitors. To put it into perspective, it would take almost 120 days for Jeep dealers to sell out all their inventory at the current sales rate, whereas the national average is less than 60 days.\nMoreover, Jeep saw an 18% decline in sales during the fourth quarter of 2022, selling only about 143,000 units nationally. This decline in sales volume, coupled with the surplus inventory, highlights the struggles Jeep is currently facing in the market.\nModel Offerings To understand why Jeep vehicles are not selling well, let’s take a closer look at their model offerings.\n1. Jeep Cherokee: The Cherokee is one of Jeep’s iconic models, offering a luxurious interior, heated seats, and a turbocharged 2-liter engine. It provides good fuel economy, costing less than $40,000 brand new, before discounts or incentives. This makes it an affordable option, especially considering that the average new car price is closer to $50,000.\n2. Jeep Compass: Recently redesigned for the 2023 model year, the Compass boasts four-wheel drive, a comfortable interior, and various creature comforts. Similar to the Cherokee, it is priced competitively under $40,000.\n3. Jeep Renegade: The Renegade offers affordability and style, with its cool color options and four-wheel drive capabilities. With a price tag under $30,000 (before discounts), it is a great option for crossover SUV enthusiasts.\n4. Jeep Gladiator: The Gladiator is a unique convertible off-road truck, essentially a Wrangler with a truck bed. While it serves a specific market and will be discussed in a dedicated video, it is worth mentioning as part of Jeep’s product lineup.\n5. Jeep Wrangler: Arguably Jeep’s most iconic vehicle, the Wrangler appeals to off-road enthusiasts. It has seen significant price increases due to high demand, but customers are still willing to pay for its rugged capabilities.\n6. Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer: These full-size SUVs offer luxury and expansive features. The Grand Wagoneer, priced over $100,000, and the Wagoneer, priced in the $60,000 to $70,000 range, cater to different market segments within the luxury SUV category.\n7. Jeep Grand Cherokee: Available in various trims and price ranges, the Grand Cherokee offers both luxury and affordability. With prices ranging from $40,000 to over $80,000, customers have options to suit their preferences and budgets.\nThe Trend: Affordability and Economic Factors Upon examining Jeep’s model lineup, a trend emerges. Affordable models such as the Cherokee, Compass, and Renegade are readily available for sale, while the higher-end versions, like the Grand Wagoneer and Wrangler Rubicon 392, are almost completely sold out.\nTo understand this trend, we need to consider economic factors. In recent years, interest rates on new cars have skyrocketed, averaging around 10%. This significantly impacts the affordability of vehicles, particularly for consumers who rely on financing. The average Jeep customer falls into this category, and the high interest rates, coupled with inflation, have made it increasingly challenging for them to consider purchasing a new Jeep.\nIn contrast, the high-end Jeep models cater to a different demographic, one that is financially stable and not as affected by the economic challenges facing the average consumer. These individuals still have the means to afford luxury vehicles despite the economic climate.\nReliability Concerns Another factor affecting Jeep’s sales is the growing concern over reliability. Recent reports have painted Jeep as a less reliable brand compared to its competitors. Some reports even indicate that Jeep is now considered less reliable than Land Rover, which is concerning for a brand rooted in off-road adventure and durability.\nThe perception of poor reliability can greatly impact consumer decisions, especially in a market where buyers prioritize dependability. Jeep’s reputation as a brand that can go anywhere may be tarnished if consumers doubt the reliability of their vehicles. This likely contributes to the decline in sales, particularly for models targeting the average consumer.\nConclusion In conclusion, Jeep is struggling in the market due to various factors. Their surplus inventory, declining sales figures, concerns over reliability, and economic challenges contribute to their current situation. While Jeep continues to offer a range of models that cater to different customer preferences and budgets, affordability and reliability are significant considerations for consumers. As interest rates rise and concerns over reliability persist, Jeep must address these issues to regain their market strength and boost sales.\n","wordCount":"801","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Oliver Armstrong"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://thecarcolony.github.io/posts/do-jeep-cherokees-hold-their-value/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Car Colony","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://thecarcolony.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/ accesskey=h title="The Car Colony (Alt + H)"><img src=https://thecarcolony.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Car Colony</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Do Jeep Cherokees Hold Their Value: A Look into Jeep's Struggles in the Market</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 18, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;801 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Oliver Armstrong</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#the-facts-and-figures>The Facts and Figures</a></li><li><a href=#model-offerings>Model Offerings</a></li><li><a href=#the-trend-affordability-and-economic-factors>The Trend: Affordability and Economic Factors</a></li><li><a href=#reliability-concerns>Reliability Concerns</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gl4aqsM6sQQ style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In this article, we will delve into the reasons behind Jeep&rsquo;s declining sales and struggling brand image.
