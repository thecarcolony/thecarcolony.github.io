If you have ever been confused about what bolt pattern is right for your GMC 2500, you’re not alone. Many customers have reached out to us at Custom Offsets with questions about bolt patterns, so we decided to create this ultimate guide to help you understand it all. By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear understanding of bolt patterns and what to expect when you purchase wheels and tires for your GMC 2500.\nWhat is a Bolt Pattern? Before we delve into the specifics, let’s start with the basics. A bolt pattern refers to the configuration of the bolt holes on your wheel and determines how it will fit on your vehicle. For example, if you have a Chevy 1500, the bolt pattern might be listed as “6 by 5.5.” The “6” represents the number of bolt holes, while the “5.5” represents the measurement between the centers of two adjacent bolt holes.\nDual Drilled Wheels One concept that confuses many people is the idea of dual drilled wheels. This occurs when a wheel has two different bolt patterns, allowing it to fit multiple vehicles. For example, a wheel might be dual drilled for both Toyota Tacomas and Ram 1500s. This is a cost-effective solution for manufacturers, as they don’t need to create separate molds for each bolt pattern. Instead, they can produce one wheel that fits multiple vehicles, saving time and money.\nInches vs. Millimeters When it comes to bolt patterns, you may notice that some measurements are listed in inches while others are listed in millimeters. This can lead to confusion, especially if you’re not familiar with both units of measurement. For example, a Chevrolet 1500 might have a bolt pattern listed as “6 on 5.5” in inches, but the same pattern could be listed as “6 by 139.7” in millimeters. The reason for this discrepancy is simply a matter of convenience. Manufacturers use the unit of measurement that is easier to work with and understand for each particular vehicle.\nHow to Measure Bolt Patterns If you ever need to measure the bolt pattern of your GMC 2500, it’s actually quite simple. In the case of a dual five-lug wheel, you can measure from the center of the far-right corner to the center of the far-across corner. This distance will give you the second portion of your bolt pattern. For example, if you measure 5.5 inches across, your bolt pattern is 5 on 5.5. Additionally, if you’re measuring in millimeters, you can convert the measurement to inches by finding the equivalent value.\nCovered vs. Exposed Center Caps Another factor to consider when choosing wheels for your GMC 2500 is the style of the center cap. Many wheels come with covered center caps, which hide the lug nuts and give the wheel a cleaner look. However, there is a growing trend towards exposed lug nuts, especially in the case of spike lug nuts. American Force wheels, for example, are known for their exposed lug nuts because they are custom-made to order. These wheels are forged rather than cast, meaning they are individually crafted for each customer and don’t require separate molds.\nRunning Spike Lug Nuts If you have a dual drilled wheel, you may wonder if it’s possible to run spike lug nuts. While it is technically possible, it may not look great because the extra bolt holes would be exposed. In general, spike lug nuts are more commonly used on wheels that do not have multiple bolt patterns. However, it ultimately comes down to personal preference and the aesthetic you desire for your GMC 2500.\nTroubleshooting Fitment Issues If you encounter fitment issues when trying to mount your wheels, don’t panic. It could simply be a matter of not aligning the wheel with the correct set of holes. Remember, dual drilled wheels have two different bolt patterns, so if it’s not fitting in one set of holes, try the other. If you’re still experiencing issues, don’t hesitate to reach out to our customer service team. Send us a picture or give us a call, and we’ll be happy to assist you in finding the right solution.\nConclusion By now, you should have a thorough understanding of bolt patterns and how they relate to your GMC 2500. We’ve covered the basics, discussed dual drilled wheels, explained the difference between inches and millimeters, and walked you through the process of measuring bolt patterns. Additionally, we explored the options of covered versus exposed center caps and the possibility of running spike lug nuts.
