In this article, we will discuss the key points to consider when choosing the right window tint for your car. From the different types of window tint films available to understanding VLT (Visible Light Transmission) and the benefits of ceramic films, we’ve got you covered.\n1. Not all window tint films are the same There are various types of window tint films available, each with its own characteristics. The most affordable option is the dyed film, which consists of an adhesive layer, a dyed layer, and a polyester protective layer. While this option is a cost-effective choice, it typically lasts between two to five years and may fade or turn purple over time, especially if exposed to sunlight for extended periods.\n2. Consider metallized layer films A step above dyed films is the metallized layer film, which contains both a metal layer and a dyed layer. This type of film offers better fading resistance and can help keep your car a little cooler. However, it tends to have a reflective layer, similar to a mirror effect. Chicago Auto Pros, however, does not carry this type of film, as they believe there are better performing films on the market.\n3. Look for carbon and ceramic layer films Carbon and ceramic layer films are highly recommended by Chicago Auto Pros. These films are designed to block infrared heat and provide better performance and aesthetics. Carbon films have a layer of carbon, while ceramic films have a layer of ceramic. These films are effective in blocking infrared rays, which are responsible for the heat that enters your car through the windows. Compared to dyed films that block only around 20% of infrared rays, ceramic films can block up to 98%, resulting in a significantly cooler car.\n4. Understanding Visible Light Transmission (VLT) VLT, or Visible Light Transmission, refers to the percentage of light that can pass through the window tint film. A lower VLT means less light can pass through, resulting in a darker tint. A five percent VLT, often referred to as limo tint, is very dark. On the other hand, a fifty percent VLT allows for more light transmission, creating a lighter tint. Chicago Auto Pros offers window tint films with various VLT options, ranging from five percent to eighty percent. They even have cars with different VLT percentages available for customers to experience and compare.\n5. Window tint laws and regulations Before deciding on the right window tint for your car, it’s essential to be aware of the window tint laws in your area. Each state has its own regulations regarding the permissible level of tint darkness. To find out the specific laws in your state, Chicago Auto Pros provides a link in the video description where you can easily access the necessary information.\nFrequently Asked Questions: Chicago Auto Pros often receives inquiries from customers regarding window tinting. Here are some of the most common questions and their answers:\nCan you tint your windshield? Yes, window tinting on windshields is possible and quite common. Chicago Auto Pros offers a popular option with an 80 VLT (Visible Light Transmission), which significantly reduces infrared heat and glare for both daytime and nighttime driving.\nWhat warranty is provided for the film? Chicago Auto Pros offers a lifetime warranty on their ceramic film against peeling, fading, or bubbling. This warranty ensures long-lasting performance and customer satisfaction.\nCan you tint your car in the winter? Window tinting can be done at any time of the year, including winter. In fact, winter is considered an ideal time for window tinting as shop schedules are often more flexible. There are no installation issues or concerns when tinting your car during winter months.\nFor further inquiries or to schedule your car’s window tinting, simply fill out the contact form provided in the video description. Alternatively, you can also leave a comment in the comment section below. Chicago Auto Pros looks forward to assisting you with your window tinting needs.\nIn conclusion, choosing the right window tint for your vehicle requires careful consideration. Understanding the different types of films available, the benefits of carbon and ceramic layer films, and the importance of VLT will help you make an informed decision. By selecting Chicago Auto Pros, you can trust that your car will receive high-quality window tinting and enjoy the numerous advantages it offers, from improved aesthetics to enhanced privacy and reduced heat transfer.\n","wordCount":"753","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-25T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-25T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Paul Chapman"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://thecarcolony.github.io/posts/car-tinting-prices/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Car Colony","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://thecarcolony.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/ accesskey=h title="The Car Colony (Alt + H)"><img src=https://thecarcolony.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Car Colony</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How to Choose the Right Window Tint: A Comprehensive Guide</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-25 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 25, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;753 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Paul Chapman</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-not-all-window-tint-films-are-the-same>1.
