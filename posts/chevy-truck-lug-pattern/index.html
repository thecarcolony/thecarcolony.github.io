In this episode, Kirk will provide a comprehensive guide to bolt patterns, a topic that often confuses customers. Whether you’re a seasoned car enthusiast or a beginner, this article will help you understand what a bolt pattern is and what to expect when you purchase wheels and tires.\nWhat is a Bolt Pattern? The bolt pattern refers to the number of bolt holes on a wheel and the distance between them. It is essential to match the bolt pattern of your vehicle when purchasing wheels to ensure a proper fit. In the case of Chevy trucks, the most common bolt pattern is six lug, also known as six on 5.5 inches.\nUnderstanding Dual Drilled Wheels When browsing Custom Offsets website, you may come across wheels that are dual drilled, meaning they have two bolt patterns. For example, a wheel might be listed as 6x5.5 and 6x135. This means that the wheel can fit both Chevy trucks with a 6x5.5 bolt pattern and other vehicles with a 6x135 bolt pattern.\nManufacturers often opt for dual drilled wheels to save money and simplify their inventory. Instead of creating separate molds for each bolt pattern, they produce wheels that cater to multiple vehicles. This eliminates the need for different part numbers and reduces overall manufacturing costs.\nInches vs. Millimeters One common source of confusion is the use of inches and millimeters to describe bolt patterns. While Chevy trucks typically use the 6x5.5 bolt pattern in inches, other manufacturers may use millimeters. For example, Ford may list their bolt pattern as 6x135 instead of 6x5.3 inches. The use of millimeters or inches varies from manufacturer to manufacturer and can cause confusion. However, it’s important to note that despite the different units, the bolt pattern remains the same.\nMeasuring Your Bolt Pattern To measure your bolt pattern accurately, you need to determine the distance between the bolt holes. In the case of the dual drilled 6x5.5 bolt pattern, you measure from the center of the far right corner to the center of the far across corner. This measurement will give you the second portion of your bolt pattern, which is 5.5 inches. In the case of the 6x5.5 bolt pattern, the first portion represents the number of lugs, which is 6. Therefore, a 6x5.5 bolt pattern means a wheel with six bolt holes spaced 5.5 inches apart.\nUnderstanding Center Caps When purchasing wheels, you may come across wheels with covered center caps or exposed lug nuts. Most wheels, especially those from Custom Offsets, come with covered center caps that hide the lug nuts. This gives the wheel a cleaner look. However, some newer wheels feature exposed lug nuts, which have become popular. One example is American Force wheels, which are custom-made and forged. Forged wheels allow for exposed lug nuts and have become a trend in the market.\nCan You Use Spike Lug Nuts? If you have a dual-drilled wheel, such as a 6-lug or 8-lug wheel, you may wonder if you can use spike lug nuts. While it is technically possible to use spike lug nuts on these wheels, it may not look aesthetically pleasing. When you install spike lug nuts, you will see the extra holes that are not in use, giving the wheel an uneven appearance. It’s best to stick with regular lug nuts for a clean and balanced look.\nTroubleshooting Fitment Issues If you encounter fitment issues when mounting your wheels, there could be a few reasons why. First, make sure you are using the correct set of holes for your bolt pattern. For dual-drilled wheels, try the other set of holes if the first set doesn’t fit. If you still experience problems, don’t hesitate to reach out to Custom Offsets for assistance. Send them a picture, and they will check the part number to ensure you have the correct fitment.\nConclusion Understanding bolt patterns is crucial when purchasing wheels for your Chevy truck. By familiarizing yourself with the concepts discussed in this article, you can confidently choose the right wheels and avoid fitment issues. Remember to measure your bolt pattern accurately, consider the use of inches or millimeters, and be aware of the different styles of center caps. And if you have any further questions or need assistance, Custom Offsets is here to help you.
