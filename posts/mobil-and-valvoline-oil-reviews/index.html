With so many motor oil brands available on the market, it can be challenging to determine which one is the best option for your vehicle. One brand that has caught the attention of many due to its affordable price is AmazonBasics Full Synthetic Motor Oil. Priced at under $20 for five quarts, it is significantly cheaper than other full synthetic brands such as Mobil 1. In this article, we will delve into a detailed comparison to find out whether AmazonBasics Full Synthetic Motor Oil is better than Mobil 1.\nKey Points Objective Testing: The YouTuber behind Project Farm, who is not sponsored by any of the brands involved - Mobil 1, AmazonBasics, or Valvoline - conducts independent testing based on viewer requests. Cold Temperature Oil Flow Test: When starting your engine, it is crucial for the oil to flow quickly to begin lubricating the engine. To test this, the oils are placed in a freezer at -15°F for 24 hours, and their performance is evaluated later in the video. American Petroleum Institute (API) Donut: All major oil brands have an API donut on their packaging, indicating essential information such as viscosity grade and the oil’s performance limits at both low and high temperatures. Viscosity Grade (e.g., 10W30): The number before the “W” represents the oil’s viscosity at low temperatures, while the number after represents its viscosity at 212°F. SN and SN Plus Ratings: Both Valvoline and Mobil 1 have an SN rating, which signifies improved high-temperature deposit protection and sludge control. AmazonBasics has an SN Plus rating, offering additional benefits for turbocharged gasoline direct injection engines. Lubricity Test: To evaluate each oil’s wear protection properties, a lubricity test is conducted by weighing and measuring the bearings before and after testing. Mobil 1 emerges as the winner, with AmazonBasics closely following. Cold Temperature Oil Flow Capability Test: After the oils have been exposed to significant heat, they are placed in the freezer again, and another cold temperature oil flow test is conducted. AmazonBasics outperforms Mobil 1 in this test, showcasing its superior cold flow capability. Step-by-Step Comparison **Cold Temperature Oil Flow Test} The oils are placed in a freezer at -15°F for 24 hours to evaluate their cold flow capability. AmazonBasics Full Synthetic Motor Oil impressively outperforms Mobil 1, flowing 2 inches ahead in the test. Both brands, however, significantly outperform Valvoline in terms of cold flow capability. API Donut The API donut on the packaging provides essential information about viscosity grade and the oil’s performance at different temperatures. Viscosity is a measure of a fluid’s flow, with the lower the W number, the better the oil’s low-temperature performance. All the tested oils meet the minimum requirements but are subject to real-world conditions that go beyond lab testing temperatures. SN and SN Plus Ratings Valvoline and Mobil 1 have an SN rating, indicating improved high-temperature deposit protection and sludge control. AmazonBasics holds an SN Plus rating, specifically designed for turbocharged gasoline direct injection engines. Unless customers own a turbocharged gasoline direct injection engine, the SN Plus designation is not necessary. Lubricity Test The oils are tested for wear protection properties using a lubricity test. Mobil 1 exhibits the best wear protection, closely followed by AmazonBasics, while Valvoline performs the poorest. The size of the scar on Mobil 1’s bearing is approximately 26% smaller than Valvoline’s and 9% smaller than AmazonBasics'. Heating and Volatility Test The oils are heated to simulate conditions around the top of piston rings in an engine’s combustion chamber. Valvoline appears to have the most vapor compared to AmazonBasics and Mobil 1. After conducting a volatility test at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 2 hours, Mobil 1 loses the least weight. Lower volatility is desirable to prevent oil from quickly evaporating. Conclusion AmazonBasics impresses with its cold flow capability, even after being exposed to heat. Mobil 1 showcases superior wear protection, but AmazonBasics is not far behind. The affordability of AmazonBasics makes it an attractive option for car owners. The YouTuber, Project Farm, has no financial interest in any of the oil brands and conducts unbiased testing. Final Thoughts Based on the extensive testing done by Project Farm, it is clear that AmazonBasics Full Synthetic Motor Oil holds its own against Mobil 1, a well-known and respected brand. While Mobil 1 exhibits better wear protection, AmazonBasics outperforms it in terms of cold flow capability, even after exposure to heat. Furthermore, AmazonBasics is considerably more affordable than Mobil 1, making it an appealing choice for car owners on a budget.\nIt is essential to note that oil preferences can vary depending on specific vehicle requirements and the manufacturer’s recommendations. It is always wise to consult your vehicle’s owner manual and seek professional advice when choosing the right motor oil for your car. By understanding the key differences and performance characteristics outlined in this article, you’ll be better equipped to make an informed decision when it comes to selecting the appropriate motor oil for your vehicle’s needs.\n","wordCount":"852","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-05T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Richard Williams"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://thecarcolony.github.io/posts/mobil-and-valvoline-oil-reviews/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Car Colony","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://thecarcolony.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/ accesskey=h title="The Car Colony (Alt + H)"><img src=https://thecarcolony.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Car Colony</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Is AmazonBasics Full Synthetic Motor Oil Better Than Mobil 1?
