In this article, we will delve into Evan Michielsâ€™ personal experience of owning a Tesla Model 3 with white interior seats for over three years. With over 41,000 miles logged, Evan shares his thoughts, regrets (if any), and offers valuable insights on how to keep your white seats looking pristine. So, letâ€™s get started!\nThe Quest for Unique Interior\nBack in December 2018, Evan embarked on his search for the perfect Tesla Model 3 with a unique interior. He gravitated towards the white seats, as he wanted something different from the traditional black, brown, and tan options offered by legacy automakers. However, at that time, there was a scarcity of information regarding the white interior seats on the Tesla Model 3. Evan scoured YouTube and found only a handful of videos, most of which focused on the white interior of the Model X. Nevertheless, one video caught his attention and convinced him to take the plunge.\nThe Cleanup Process\nEvan was especially concerned about maintenance due to his occupation in shipping logistics, which can be a dirty job. However, the video he stumbled upon showcased how simple the cleanup process was for the white interior seats. Intrigued, Evan decided to invest an additional $1,000 for the upgraded white seats. Since then, he has been documenting the progress of his white interior seats over the years, and the results have been overwhelmingly positive.\nEffective Cleaning Techniques\nOne significant advantage Evan discovered was the ease of cleaning the white seats. Using his preferred cleaner spray, the lithium hyper cleanse, he demonstrated the impressive stain removal ability of the product. Evan allowed the solution to saturate the seat for a few minutes before wiping it down with a high-quality microfiber towel. To his surprise, the first wipe-down effectively removed most of the dirt and restored the vibrant white color of the seats. In case of deeper stains, a gentle rubbing force with the cleaner spray and microfiber towel was sufficient. However, he did encounter a stubborn blue streak line on the rear passenger seat, possibly from a rideshare passenger. Despite trying various cleaning methods like dish soap and magic erasers, Evan struggled to completely eradicate the stain. It was then that he discovered the Geon Leather Shield Protectant.\nThe Power of Geon Leather Shield Protectant\nEvan noticed that many Tesla owners, particularly those with white seats, recommended using the Geon Leather Shield Protectant. Intrigued by its stain-repellent properties, he decided to give it a try. To his delight, the thin layer of ceramic coat protectant not only helped repel dirt and liquid but also maintained the original feel and color of the seats. Evan now applies the protectant to his driverâ€™s seat twice a year and the rest of the interior once a year. Thanks to regular cleaning and the added assurance of the Geon Leather Shield Protectant, he observed that the blue line on the rear passenger seat gradually faded away over time, practically becoming imperceptible to the naked eye.\nDurability and Longevity\nAfter three years of rigorous use, Evanâ€™s white Tesla Model 3 seats have withstood the test of time. He proudly declares that he has no regrets about choosing the white interior. The driverâ€™s seat remains in excellent condition, while the rest of the seats still retain their factory-new look. Despite initial concerns about potential dirt and stains, Evan emphasizes that regular wipe-downs every few months, combined with the application of the Geon Leather Shield Protectant, have proven remarkably effective in keeping the seats looking pristine.\nFinal Thoughts and Recommendations\nEvan concludes his review by urging viewers to consider the white interior option for their Tesla Model 3. He assures them that with proper maintenance and the application of the Geon Leather Shield Protectant, the white seats can withstand the test of time and maintain their original allure. Moreover, he encourages prospective buyers to explore the abundance of resources available on YouTube, unlike when he made his decision in 2018. The YouTube description of Evanâ€™s video provides links to the products he personally uses for maintaining his white interior, offering viewers a convenient way to access them.\nConclusion\nIn summary, Evan Michielsâ€™ three-year review of his Tesla Model 3 white interior seats provides valuable insights into the durability, maintenance, and overall satisfaction of choosing this unique interior option. Through his personal experiences and product recommendations, Evan offers a comprehensive guide to ensure the longevity and pristine appearance of your white Tesla Model 3 seats. So, if youâ€™re looking for a distinctive and elegant interior, donâ€™t let concerns about maintenance hold you back. Take a cue from Evanâ€™s positive experience and embrace the timeless allure of white Tesla Model 3 interior seats.\nRemember, with proper care, your white interior seats will continue to impress for years to come.
