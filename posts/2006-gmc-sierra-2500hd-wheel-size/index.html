In this article, we will discuss three different tire sizes and compare their pros and cons. We will also provide recommendations on how to fit these popular tire sizes with some of the most popular lift kits. Whether you’re a daily driver or an off-roader, this article will help you make an informed decision.\nKey Points Introduction to different tire sizes: The transcript begins by introducing three trucks with different tire sizes – a 2016 Silverado with stock 31 inch tires, a 2014 Silverado with a 3.75 inch lift and 33 inch tires, and a 2011 Sierra with a 7.5 inch lift and 35 inch tires. Stock tire size: The article explains that the stock tire size for the 2016 Silverado is a 255 70 17 Bridgestone Dueler HD tire, which is an all-season tire. It discusses the characteristics of the stock tire and provides information about the wheel size and offset. Upgrading to 33 inch tires: The article discusses the benefits of upgrading to 33 inch tires, such as improved off-road performance and a more aggressive look. It explains that a lift kit is necessary to fit these tires without rubbing on the stock components. The article also mentions the noise level of mud terrain tires and suggests considering all-terrain tires for a quieter ride. Fitting 35 inch tires: The article addresses the challenges of fitting 35 inch tires on these trucks, particularly due to the square wheel wells. It recommends at least a 6 inch lift kit and minor modifications to eliminate rubbing. The article highlights the importance of choosing the right offset to avoid clearance issues. On-road and off-road performance: The article provides insights into the driving experience with 33 inch tires, discussing factors such as noise level, fuel efficiency, and handling. It emphasizes the benefits of increased clearance for off-roading and the preference for a wider tire when tackling rough terrains. Choosing the right tire size: The article concludes by summarizing the pros and cons of each tire size and offering recommendations based on individual preferences and requirements. Step-by-Step Process Determine the stock tire size: Start by understanding the stock tire size for your Chevy Silverado or GMC Sierra. The transcript mentions that the 2016 Silverado comes with a 255 70 17 Bridgestone Dueler HD tire. Evaluate the characteristics of the stock tire: Consider factors like comfort, traction, and fuel economy when evaluating the stock tire. The article explains that the stock tire provides decent traction and good fuel economy. Upgrade to 33 inch tires: If you’re looking for improved off-road performance and a more aggressive look, consider upgrading to 33 inch tires. However, keep in mind that a lift kit is necessary to fit these tires without rubbing on stock components. The article suggests using at least a 2 inch leveling kit or a lift kit to ensure proper clearance. Choose the right offset: When selecting aftermarket wheels for your 33 inch tires, consider the offset to avoid clearance issues. The transcript mentions a negative six millimeter offset, which pushes the wheel out towards the outside of the truck. Consider noise level and ride comfort: Keep in mind that mud terrain tires might be noisier on the road compared to all-terrain tires. If you want a quieter ride, opt for all-terrain tires that still offer adequate off-road performance. Explore the option of 35 inch tires: If you’re seeking a more substantial and aggressive look, you may consider fitting 35 inch tires. However, be prepared for the challenges of fitting these tires due to the square wheel wells. A 6 inch lift kit and minor modifications may be necessary to eliminate rubbing. Test the driving experience: To gauge the on-road and off-road performance of your chosen tire size, take your truck for a drive. Pay attention to factors such as noise level, handling, and fuel efficiency. The article suggests considering the trade-offs between a larger tire size and increased resistance. Conclusion Choosing the right tire size for your Chevy Silverado or GMC Sierra is crucial to optimize performance and style. Whether you’re looking for improved off-road capabilities or simply want a more aggressive look, understanding the pros and cons of each tire size is essential. Take into consideration factors such as clearance, noise level, and handling when making your decision. By following the recommendations in this article, you can confidently upgrade your tires and enjoy an enhanced driving experience.\n","wordCount":"758","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sherry Coons"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://thecarcolony.github.io/posts/2006-gmc-sierra-2500hd-wheel-size/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Car Colony","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://thecarcolony.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/ accesskey=h title="The Car Colony (Alt + H)"><img src=https://thecarcolony.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Car Colony</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How to Choose the Right Tire Size for Your Chevy Silverado or GMC Sierra</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 1, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;758 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Sherry Coons</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#key-points>Key Points</a></li><li><a href=#step-by-step-process>Step-by-Step Process</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wdcfMAyUE6E style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>When it comes to upgrading the tires on your Chevy Silverado or GMC Sierra, it&rsquo;s important to choose the right tire size for your vehicle.
