One particular case in Gwinnett County has shed light on the potential dangers associated with these clutch issues. As a consumer investigator, it is important to delve into this matter and explore how widespread the problem is, while also urging federal safety regulators to take action. In this article, we will uncover the details behind the clutch problems, analyze the possible causes, and discuss the implications it has for both Fiat 500 owners and other road users.\nWhen it comes to diagnosing the clutch problems in the Fiat 500, it appears that a specific part of the clutch assembly is often the culprit. A seasoned mechanic with 40 years of experience claims to have seen three cases in which the same plate within the clutch assembly failed in the exact same manner. This plate, referred to as the finger plate, has been identified as a potential cause for concern. By examining three Fiat clutch cases, the mechanic discovered that the finger plate developed a crack, indicating a lack of quality in the metal used. This defect poses not only a safety hazard for the driver but also for anyone who comes to their aid if their car stalls.\nNumerous complaints have been filed with federal regulators regarding clutch problems in the 2012 Fiat 500. In fact, two-thirds of these complaints specifically mentioned issues with the clutch getting stuck, with some referencing the malfunctions in the thinker plate, as discovered by the aforementioned mechanic. Additionally, Fiat internet forums are buzzing with discussions about these clutch problems, further highlighting the need for a thorough investigation into the issue.\nWhile Fiat 500 owners demand immediate attention to this matter, the manufacturer has claimed that this problem is an anomaly. However, it is essential to address the concerns discussed by the consumers. The scarcity of replacement parts has added another layer of frustration for affected individuals, as authorized dealers have reported shortages of the required plates. As a result, owners like Traci No Tosh find themselves in a difficult position, desperate to get their cars fixed and regain their peace of mind. The hazards they face on the road due to the faulty clutch not only jeopardize their own safety but also the safety of others who may stop to assist them.\nIn the case of Traci No Tosh, Fiat has assured her that her case is being escalated to the highest level of customer care. However, this does not address the larger issue at hand. Both Fiat and federal regulators need to acknowledge the multitude of complaints and safety concerns regarding the defective clutch plates. Such problems should not be brushed aside as anomalies, as they have the potential to cause serious accidents and harm.\nIn conclusion, the clutch problems in the Fiat 500 are a cause for concern, as they potentially put the safety of both the driver and others at risk. The faulty finger plate within the clutch assembly has been identified as a key problem area. With numerous complaints filed and discussions on internet forums, it is clear that this issue extends beyond isolated incidents. Fiat and federal safety regulators must work together to investigate and rectify these issues promptly. By doing so, they can ensure the safety and peace of mind of Fiat 500 owners, as well as the general public on the roads.\nKey Points: The Fiat 500 has been plagued with clutch problems, raising concerns among owners and experts. The finger plate within the clutch assembly is often the cause behind these issues, with multiple cases reporting cracks in the metal. Complaints filed with federal regulators indicate that the clutch often gets stuck, specifically referencing the thinker plate. Fiat’s response to the issue has been dismissive, claiming it as an anomaly. Shortage of replacement parts has further exacerbated the frustration for owners seeking repairs. The safety hazards associated with the faulty clutch put both the driver and others at risk on the road. Urgent action is needed from both Fiat and federal safety regulators to investigate and address these issues promptly, ensuring the safety of Fiat 500 owners and the general public.
