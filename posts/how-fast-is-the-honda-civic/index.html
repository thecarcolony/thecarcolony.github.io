This beast on wheels has left car enthusiasts in awe with its mind-blowing speed and performance on both the street and the track. Get ready to discover the key highlights, specifications, and mind-bending details of this fastest Honda car on the street.\nIntroduction\nWelcome back to another exciting episode of That Racing Channel. Today, we have a special treat for all you Honda fans out there. The spotlight is on Danny and his awe-inspiring AWD Honda Civic, also known as “Frustrate.” With over 1300 horsepower under the hood, this Honda Civic is a force to be reckoned with. Let’s dive into the details and explore everything that makes this car a true masterpiece.\nThe Build\nThe engine setup of this awe-inspiring Honda Civic includes a k24/k20 combo with a 2.4-liter K20C1 head. It is equipped with the same cams and other components, making it a reliable and powerful machine. The real star of the show is the massive 76mm garage turbo, which has been upgraded to a 90mm variant. Running on BP gas and E85 fuel, this Civic is ready to unleash its true potential on the track.\nFuel System\nTo ensure smooth power delivery, the car runs on a mechanical fuel pump with dual injectors on every cylinder. The fuel system includes a three-gallon fuel cell at the front of the vehicle. This setup has proven to be highly efficient, enabling the car to perform flawlessly on both the street and the track.\nPowerhouse Performance\nThis AWD Honda Civic has set the bar high with its record-breaking performance on the drag strip. With an impressive fastest pass of 7.92 seconds at 187 mph, this car is a true speed demon. The transmission has been upgraded to withstand the immense power, making the car capable of handling 70 pounds of boost.\nDriving Experience\nThe driver’s seat of this Honda Civic is an adrenaline-filled experience. With the nitrous assist and the immense raw power, it takes a skilled driver to harness its full potential. The car goes from 0 to 60 mph in just seconds, launching with incredible force. It might be a bit intimidating for some, but once you get used to it, the exhilaration is incomparable.\nTrack and Street Setup\nDanny’s Civic is built for both the track and the street. On the street, the car runs on a lower boost, ensuring it adheres to safety standards and regulations. However, on the track, it unleashes its full might and reaches astonishing speeds. The meticulously designed roll cage and safety features provide the necessary protection during high-speed runs.\nHandling and Suspension\nTo ensure optimal handling and performance, this Honda Civic has received numerous upgrades to its suspension, drivetrain, and differential. It features an all-wheel-drive setup with wagon parts, including a drag wagon driveshaft and 1320 joints. The transmission is equipped with an Abel housing and a PPG one through four gear set.\nChallenges and Limits\nPushing a car to this level of performance is not without its challenges. The engine block begins to face limitations beyond 1300 horsepower, with the studs at risk of failure. This leads to the block cracking and potential damage to the engine. To mitigate this risk, many Honda racers opt for building their engines with stronger components.\nUnmatched Honda Performance\nThe Honda Civic has evolved into an iconic platform for high-performance racing. With its lightweight design and incredible power-to-weight ratio, it showcases the true potential of a four-cylinder engine. The capabilities and achievements of this Honda Civic are a testament to the dedication and expertise of Danny and his team.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, Danny’s AWD Honda Civic is a true champion of the streets and the track. With its mind-blowing 1400 horsepower, this car has left its mark on the world of high-performance racing. It exhibits the exceptional capabilities of Honda engineering and showcases what is possible with the right modifications and passion for racing. We look forward to seeing more from Danny and his incredible Honda Civic in the future.\n","wordCount":"696","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"John Mcclendon"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://thecarcolony.github.io/posts/how-fast-is-the-honda-civic/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Car Colony","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://thecarcolony.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/ accesskey=h title="The Car Colony (Alt + H)"><img src=https://thecarcolony.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>The Car Colony</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://thecarcolony.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>**1400HP AWD Civic: Unbelievably Fast Street Honda**</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 11, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;696 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;John Mcclendon</div></header><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5P4bRsFkv_A style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p><a href=https://cdn.rankmath.com/blog/seo-tests/honda-civic-speed-test.jpg><img loading=lazy src=https://cdn.rankmath.com/blog/seo-tests/honda-civic-speed-test.jpg alt=Thumbnail></a></p><p>In this article, we will take a deep dive into the world of Honda racing with an exclusive look at Danny&rsquo;s AWD Honda Civic that boasts an astonishing 1400 horsepower.
